# Interactive Client Examples - Improvements

## Changes Made

Updated the `examples` command output in the interactive MCP client to provide **real, working command examples** with clear explanations.

### Before vs After

#### 1. Query Farms
**Before:**
- Basic examples without context
- No explanation of combining filters

**After:**
```
Example 6: Combine multiple filters
  → query group=Muku min_animals=50 year=2024
  Get Muku farms with 50+ animals from 2024

Tip: Shows "Up to 100 farms (use limit parameter for more)"
```

#### 2. Farm Details
**Before:**
- Single basic example
- No workflow guidance

**After:**
```
Tip: Use query to find TVD IDs first:
  → query group=Muku limit=5
  → farm tvd=<id_from_query>

Returns comprehensive data:
  • TVD ID, year, and assigned group
  • 6 binary classification indicators
  • All fields used for classification
```

#### 3. Compare Groups
**Before:**
```
Example 2: Compare specific groups (coming soon)
  → compare groups=Muku,Milchvieh
```

**After:**
```
Example 2: Compare specific groups
  → compare groups=Muku,Milchvieh
  → compare groups=BKMmZ,BKMoZ,IKM
  Compare just the groups you're interested in

Example 3: Compare with specific metrics
  → compare metrics=n_animals_total,n_females_age3_dairy
  Focus on particular fields only
```

#### 4. Aggregations
**Before:**
```
Example 1: Total animals by group (in Python dict format)
  Note: Currently requires dict syntax - will be simplified

Example 2: Average by year and group
  Note: Aggregations work with pandas syntax
```

**After:**
```
Example 1: Total animals by group
  → aggregate group_by=group aggregate={'n_animals_total':'sum'}
  Sum of all animals per farm group

Example 2: Average animals by year
  → aggregate group_by=year aggregate={'n_animals_total':'mean'}
  Average farm size per year

Example 3: Multiple aggregations
  → aggregate group_by=group aggregate={'n_animals_total':'sum','n_females_age3_dairy':'mean'}
  Combine different operations

Example 4: Group by multiple fields
  → aggregate group_by=group,year aggregate={'n_animals_total':'count'}
  Count farms by group and year
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Actual Commands**
Every example now shows the **exact command** to type, not placeholders.

### 2. **Clear Explanations**
Each example includes what it does and what results to expect.

### 3. **Progressive Complexity**
Examples build from simple to complex, showing how to combine features.

### 4. **Real Syntax**
Shows actual parameter format (comma-separated lists, dict syntax, etc.)

### 5. **Workflow Tips**
Demonstrates how commands work together (query → farm details workflow)

### 6. **Removed "Coming Soon"**
Removed placeholder text for features that are actually working.

## Impact

Users can now:
- **Copy-paste** examples directly from help
- **Understand** what each command actually does
- **Learn** by seeing progressive examples
- **Discover** feature combinations
- **Avoid errors** by seeing correct syntax

## Testing

All examples have been verified to work with the current implementation:
- ✅ Query filters (single and combined)
- ✅ Compare groups (all and specific)
- ✅ Aggregate operations (single and multiple fields)
- ✅ Custom metrics with pandas expressions
- ✅ Natural language questions
- ✅ Insights with focus parameters

## Documentation Philosophy

**Show, Don't Tell:**
- Real commands, not descriptions
- Working examples, not theoretical syntax
- Clear outcomes, not vague promises
- Actual syntax, not placeholders
